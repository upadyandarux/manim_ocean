# manim_ocean

These programs were made to fulfill the needs for completing two subjects in Oceanography Major. 
MatosI.py for completing Mathematical Methods in Oceanography I. 
MatosIIScene1-10.py and MatosIIScene11-20.py for completing Mathematical Methods in Oceanography II. 

All of these were compiled by using Python with Manim as its library. 
MatosI will show you what is Eigenvectors and Eigenvalue is while MatosII will show you what is Diffusion in scope of PDE (Partial Differential Equation) is.

Enjoy!
